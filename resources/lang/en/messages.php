        'history' => "The I Ching, also known as the Book of Changes or Classic of Changes, is a classical Chinese text that has a rich and complex history. The book was originally created as a divination manual during the Western Zhou Dynasty (1000–750 BCE) and was transformed, throughout the Warring States period and early imperial period (500–200 BCE), into a cosmological text with a series of philosophical commentaries known as the “Ten Wings”. After becoming part of the five classics in the second century BCE, the I Ching was the subject of scholarly commentary and the basis for the practice of divination for centuries in the East, and also played an influential role in the West's understanding of Eastern thought. The “I Ching” can be understood and studied both as an oracle and as a book of wisdom. In China itself, it is the subject of differentiated study carried out by religious people, scholars and practitioners of the Taoist philosophy of life. The I Ching is one of humanity's oldest books and one of China's most preserved heritages. It is estimated that it was written around 1,200 years before our era and is of Taoist origin. The name in English means “book of mutations”. In the West, the I Ching became popular as an oracle. The book is simultaneously one of the most complex and elaborate divinatory and signification systems that have ever existed. The semiotic complexity of the system is superior in every way to that of systems such as Nordic runes or tarot. Like other divinatory systems, the “I Ching” can be used as a tool to define the contents of any semiotic structure, whether in the light of psychoanalysis of psychic alchemy, for example, in literary analysis, musical composition, cinema and all a range of other trans-disciplinary practices.",
        'about' => "The I Ching is an ancient Chinese oracle that can be used as a guide for everyday choices. Consultation with this oracle is done using 3 coins or, in some cases, sticks or cards. To understand what I Ching is, it is necessary to understand its constitution: the book is made up of 64 different symbols – each hexagram is made up of two trigrams, totaling 6 lines, whole and/or cut. When consulting the meaning of a hexagram in the I Ching, it is possible to find some information; The first of these is the ideogram, or the name itself of the guà. There is also the judgment: meaning of the hexagram in a more symbolic way, followed by texts of the lines, containing interpretations about each of the lines of the hexagram. Finally, an additional message is presented, containing a model of behavior to be followed or advice on the situation indicated by the oracle.",
        'trigrams' => "Trigrams are symbols formed by three lines that make up the I Ching. They represent the eight combination possibilities of Yin Yang in three lines, and are elements that structure the Chinese book I Ching. Each of the eight trigrams is made up of three lines, which can be whole (yang) or broken (yin). It is from the attributes of the trigrams that the meaning and different meanings of each of the 64 hexagrams are deduced. The trigrams are also studied as a whole and not just to compose the content of the hexagrams. Chinese masters are skilled in translating collective and individual cycles, as well as deducing opportune conduct from the different circular distributions of the eight trigrams.",
